APSONIC Official Website Homepage Design Competition Brief

I. Project Background
APSONIC is a core brand under De Cheng Holdings Group, dedicated to the research and development, sales, and after-sales service of motorcycles and related accessories. Since its establishment, the brand has consistently advocated the philosophy of “Quality for Better Life,” aiming to meet local consumers’ transportation needs with high-quality, regionally adaptable, and diversified products. Renowned for its economic efficiency, durability, and reliable performance, APSONIC has become a top-tier motorcycle brand of choice for daily commuting and short-distance transportation among people in West Africa.

To further strengthen its market presence, APSONIC now seeks to create a professional, international, and locally friendly official website. The target audience includes African families and individuals with convenient mobility needs, rural and urban transport operators, as well as distributors and partners—with distributors being the primary focus. This design competition aims to showcase the brand’s core values through designers’ creativity, and the winning proposal will secure a formal cooperation contract.
